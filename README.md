##  Overview
- This project implements a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** agent to play *Flappy Bird*.  
- The game environment and parameters are adapted from [yenchenlin/DeepLearningFlappyBird](https://github.com/yenchenlin DeepLearningFlappyBird), with several modifications for modern PyTorch compatibility and more stable training.
- The core DQN training framework is based on *Hands-on Reinforcement Learning (动手学强化学习)*, with adjustments to fit the Flappy Bird environment
